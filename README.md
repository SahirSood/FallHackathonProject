Participants:

Project Description:
The project is a 2D endless runner written primarily in Python and the PyGame modules.
In the game, you play as a man struggling with alchohol addiction who is attempting to
"turn a new leaf" in his life by avoiding his addiction.
During the game, the player must jump over all of the beers as they approach, aiming for a high score.
How long can you survive before relapsing into your addiction?

How to Run:
To install pygame, run the command pip install pygame 
Inside of the zip file, run main.py using the command python main.py

File Structure:
All of the main python files are located in the root directory of the repository.  Additional sprites and images
used in the game are contained within their own folders.

Libraries, APIs, and Resources:
