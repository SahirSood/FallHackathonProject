Project Description:
The project is a 2D endless runner written primarily in Python and the PyGame modules.
In the game, you play as a man struggling with alchohol addiction who is attempting to
"turn a new leaf" in his life by avoiding his addiction.
During the game, the player must jump over all of the beers as they approach, aiming for a high score.

File Structure:
All of the main python files are located in the root directory of the repository.  Additional sprites and images
used in the game are contained within their own folders.

Libraries, APIs, and Resources:
To create our game, we primarily used the pygame library found within python's built-in libraries.
